# MAP Project

## Project detail
1. Convert physical addresses to Latitude & Longitude, then save to Excel file as an output.
2. Generate Heatmap by using all Latitude & Longitude(Lat & Lng) generated from (1).
3. Return drive distance from each distribution centre to each client, then save to Excel file as an output.
4. Return drive time from each distribution centre(DC) to each client, then save to Excel file as an output.
5. Clustering with displacement approach
6. Generate results (clustering results, efficiency of clustering results, suggested location(Lat & Lng) of each DC)
